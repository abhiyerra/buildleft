# BuildLeft

Direct people who may be in trouble in America due to the policies of the new administration get help while also provide those organizations volunteers, donations and resources.

Create a platform for the Left to mobilize, to fight laws at the local level, and get the Left more involved in democracy across America by using lean and agile techniques.
